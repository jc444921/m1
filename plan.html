<h1>CP1406 - 2015 Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Team02</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Shemal, Kritpal , Xiting Jia</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p> The goal is to develop a website for the client, Townsville Community Music Center which can provide a clear and specific information of the upcoming events, performance opportunities to interested musicians/singers, memberships and associated advantages, TCMC's history and vision, volunteering information as well as artist information. The main reason to develop the site is to serve the stakeholders- the client, sponsors, musicians/singers and audience with all the relevant information at one place(website) in the easiest way possible. It will help the client to attract audience, volunteers, members and new talent as well as generation of revenue through sale of ticket (but not online).</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The goals are set to be SMART, that is Specific, Measurable, Atainable, Relevant and Time-bound. At the same time certain parameters have been set up to evaluate the success and efficiency of the website. Below are some of the parametrs used for the evaluation. <br>
<li>Number of new members associated with the organization in 6 months after the launch of website.</li>
<li>Number of visitors that have visited the website.</li>
<li>Number of ne volunteers associated with the organization in 6 months after the launch of website. </li>
<li>Number of tickets sold after the launch of website.</li>
<li>Feedback from the users.</li>
</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> The audience has been categorised into following two groups-
<li><strong>Youth</strong>- The audience between the age group of 15 to 35. The group primarily inclined towards modern music types like <strong>Jazz, Rock, Western music</strong> hence the dedicated events and programs will be conducted to attract this segment of audience. For example- The performance by <strong>The Dirty Dozen Stage Band</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mature</strong>- The audience between the age group of 36 and above (primarily under 65) are inclined towards classical and traditional kind of music, hence the dedicated event covering traditional and folk music will be conducted to cater the audience of this segment.
